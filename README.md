## Why

Some popular publishing sites, including [substack](https://substack.com/) use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) to provide content caching and DDoS protection.

If cloudflare suspects that your machine is a bot, they throw up a [challenge](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/concepts/cloudflare-challenges/) - this is normally just a page that requires your browser to run some javascript which filters out simple scrapers that don't evaluate scripts. This means that Freshrss sometimes fails to retrieve feeds protected by cloudflare and it isn't "smart" enough to pass these cloudflare filters on its own.

This FreshRSS extension uses [Flaresolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr/) to start a headless browser (essentially a full copy of chrome or firefox but without a UI to look at) to parse and resolve these challenges and send the contents of an RSS feed through to FreshRSS as normal.

I stumbled across [ryancom16's solution](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/issues/4323) and decided to have a go at hardening it into a proper FreshRSS Plugin

## Install

### Set up FlareSolverr
You will need an instance of FlareSolverr running somewhere that is accessible to your FreshRSS instance. If you are using Docker Compose to manage FreshRSS then you can add FlareSolverr to your compose file. An example setup is shown below:

```yaml
version: "2.1"
services:
  flaresolverr:
    image: ghcr.io/flaresolverr/flaresolverr:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      - LOG_LEVEL=info
    ports:
      - 8191:8191

  freshrss:
    image: freshrss/freshrss:latest
    container_name: freshrss
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/London
      - CRON_MIN=1,31
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/www/FreshRSS/data
      - ./extensions:/var/www/FreshRSS/extensions 
    ports:
      - 8081:80
    restart: unless-stopped

```

> [!TIP]
> 2025/08/09: The new version of the plugin is not fully supported by `latest` yet (1.26.3). You can try running `edge` to benefit from the new behaviour no longer requires manual copying of files and changing folder permissions. However, edge is not stable so your mileage may vary.

### Install the Plugin

1. Copy this whole directory to your FreshRSS `extensions` directory. The easiest option is probably to clone this repo:

```bash
cd /path/to/freshrss/extensions
git clone https://github.com/ravenscroftj/freshrss-flaresolverr-extension.git
```

2. Enable the extension from the settings page.  If you get an error message in the logs that says `Cannot enable extension FreshRss FlareSolverr: server cannot write in /var/www/FreshRSS/p/api` you can try running `docker-compose exec -u root freshrss chmod 777 /var/www/FreshRSS/p/api` and then try enabling the plugin again.

2. Paste in the URL of your FlareSolverr instance in the settings window. If you're running using the docker-compose setup above then you can enter `http://flaresolverr:8191`.

3. Copy the feed URL in bold

4. Enable API Access via Administration -> Authentication menu.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> As of FreshRSS 1.26.4 the extension uses [api_misc](https://freshrss.github.io/FreshRSS/en/developers/03_Backend/05_Extensions.html) which means you will need to turn on API Access via Administration -> Authentication menu to use this extension. If you do not do this step then all feed URLs will simply say `Service Unavailable!`.

### Configure your Feeds

Prepend any feeds protected by Cloudflare with the URL. For example if your freshrss instance is at https://freshrss.example.com/ and you want to subscribe Sebastian Ruder's excellent NLP newsletter [https://nlpnewsletter.substack.com/](https://nlpnewsletter.substack.com/), you would take the full URL to the RSS feed `https://nlpnewsletter.substack.com/feed` and set the feed url in FreshRSS to:

`https://freshrss.example.com/api/cloudsolver.php?feed=https://nlpnewsletter.substack.com/feed`

### Timeout

You can set the `maxTimeout` parameter in the control panel or by passing `maxTimeout=<miliseconds>` as a query parameter on the feed URL. The system will use whichever is the lower of these two values. The default value is 60 seconds. This allows you to have flaresolver run for longer than 60 seconds if needed.

## Upgrades to FreshRSS

Since FreshRSS 1.26.4 the extension no longer needs to copy files around and instead uses the [api_misc](https://freshrss.github.io/FreshRSS/en/developers/03_Backend/05_Extensions.html) entrypoint so the `cloudsolver.php` file is no longer needed.

### Versions Before 1.26.4

If you are running FreshRSS as a docker image you will likely need to disable and reenable the plugin after you upgrade the main application. You can do this by toggling the extension using the switch in the control panel:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/604ea7b3-c89e-4ba6-b2fe-27e57acae27c)

You may also need to re-run  `docker-compose exec -u root freshrss chmod 777 /var/www/FreshRSS/p/api` before you upgrade. This is because the extension works by creating a file in the `/p/api/` directory of the application which is not persisted by the default linuxserver docker container. Hopefully I can find a way to fix this in future.

## Limitations

This plugin only works on exact URLs for RSS feeds at the moment. It can't be used to do feed discovery. This is due to a limitation with [the way that selenium works](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr/blob/master/src/flaresolverr_service.py#L398).

## Troubleshooting

### Missing text in plugin settings screen

If the text/translations are not showing up in the plugin settings screen you might be looking at it with the plugin disabled. Try turning the plugin on and the text should show up.

### Can't enable the plugin

If turning on the plugin gives an and you are using FreshRSS V1.26.3 or older, you might be experiencing a permissions error. Check the system logs to confirm. Try running `docker-compose exec -u root freshrss chmod 777 /var/www/FreshRSS/p/api` and re-enabling the plugin.

### All feeds give Service Unavailable!

If you're running FreshRSS V1.26.4 or later and the plugin prepend url has `/api/misc.php` in it, you might not have turned on API access. Go to via Administration -> Authentication menu and tick Allow API access.

### Problem Fetching Feed

If you are having trouble fetching the feed, you can append `&raw=1` to the URL to force HTML support for example when using XPath scraping.
